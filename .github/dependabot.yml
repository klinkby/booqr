# Configure Dependabot to enforce a 7-day cooldown period for NuGet packages
# This security measure helps prevent supply chain injection attacks by:
# - Waiting for the community to detect and report malicious packages
# - Blocking ~80% of supply chain attacks that exploit fast compromise windows
# - Allowing time for security scanners to identify vulnerabilities
